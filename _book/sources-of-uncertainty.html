<h1><span class="header-section-number">Section 2</span> Sources of uncertainty</h1>
<p><h5right> Uncertainty can feed through into analysis from many different sources. Each step in data collection, data processing and modelling is likely to bring added uncertainty. <br><br> Try to identify and record all the potential sources of uncertainty in your analysis at an early stage. Early identification of uncertainty is important, if you overlook a potential source of uncertainty this could reduce the usefulness and impact of your subsequent analysis. </h5right></p>
<h4>
Classifications of uncertainty
</h4>
<p><h5right> It is useful to distinguish between distinct classifications of uncertainty. Firstly, understanding the characteristics of different classifications of uncertainty by type can help you to identify sources of uncertainty in your own analysis. Further, categorising the types of uncertainty in an analytical problem provides a framework for the next steps of analysis. Once uncertainty has been identified, you should then ask: can you quantify the uncertainty, and can you reduce it?<br><br> A common classification divides uncertainty into aleatory, epistemic and ontological types. We explain these in the table below. </h5right></p>

<th>Classification</th>

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><b>Definition</b></td>
<td>Known knowns are things we know that we know. Aleatory uncertainty refers to the inherent uncertainty that is always present due to underlying probabilistic variability. Since we are aware of aleatory uncertainty and can estimate average values and variation, we usually regard it as a ‘known known’</td>
<td>Known unknowns are things that we know we don’t know. Epistemic uncertainty comes from a lack of knowledge about the (complex) system we are trying to model. Assumptions are used to plug these gaps in the absence of information.</td>
<td>Unknown unknowns are things that we don’t know we don’t know. Ontological uncertainty usually comes from factors or situations that we have not previously experienced and therefore cannot consider because we simply don’t know where to look in the first instance.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><b>Can it be quantified? </b></td>
<td>We can quantify aleatory uncertainty. We usually characterise this type of uncertainty using a probability distribution function (PDF). A PDF gives all the possible values that a variable can have and assigns a probability of occurrence to each. As analysts, the challenge for us is to derive the PDF.</td>
<td>Epistemic uncertainty can be quantified (but isn’t always) – e.g. through sensitivity analysis. These techniques quantify the uncertainty by altering assumptions and observing the impact on modelling outputs. They will work if the range of assumptions tested covers the range of unknown variables.</td>
<td>Ontological uncertainty cannot be quantified. We cannot identify unknowable unknowns, so there are no actions we can take to quantify them. What we can do is be clear about the sources of uncertainty we have included, so that any others subsequently identified would likely add to that uncertainty.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><b> Can it be reduced? </b></td>
<td>This type of uncertainty cannot be completely removed. We can sometimes reduce it through data smoothing or increasing the size of a sample, but there will always be some random variability.</td>
<td>Epistemic uncertainty is reducible. Epistemic uncertainty can be reduced by gathering information to lessen the gaps in our knowledge. Using new data sources, expanding our data collection or conducting research can remove the need for assumptions or refine their ranges.</td>
<td>This type of uncertainty is not reducible. However, ontological uncertainty can usually be separated into “unknowable unknowns” and “knowable unknowns”. Horizon scanning can help identify knowable unknowns. Once they are identified they become epistemic uncertainties.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><b> Example </b></td>
<td>Tossing a coin is an example of aleatory uncertainty. We can observe the possible outcomes (heads or tails) and the probability of each occurring (50:50), therefore create a PDF. However, prior to the coin being tossed we cannot reduce the uncertainty in outcomes.</td>
<td>Taking our coin toss example, we don’t know whether the coin is fair in the first instance. We may assume the coins is fair and will give a 50% probability of each outcome. Once we start to toss the coin, we start to gather information on its fairness. The longer we toss the coin the better our information gets and the greater the reduction in epistemic uncertainty.</td>
<td>Unknown unknown are often future events or circumstances that we cannot predict. An example could be the introduction of a new technology that was previously unheard of. If the new technology affects the operation of a system, previous analysis is no longer reliable as it didn’t account for this change.</td>

Sources of uncertainty
</h4>
<p><h5right> In this section, we set out some considerations to help you think about sources of uncertainty, and how you might quantify the size and impact of uncertainty at distinct stages of the analysis process. <br><br> To gain a full picture of the impact of uncertainty on your analysis it is important to think through what you know about the size and distribution of uncertainties, and how you might include this information in your analysis. The list is not exhaustive. Rather, it is intended as an aid to critical thinking about practical steps you can take to quantify uncertainty. <br><br> Usually, it is not possible to quantify exactly the level of uncertainty in your analysis. Where measurement is difficult or incomplete, think about what you can say about the reliability of your measures and what might be missing. </h5right></p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.6.10</span> This can be done by the analysts or using expert judgement. A simple approach to qualitatively assessing uncertainty is to RAG rate the likelihood and impact of uncertainty in your parameters. This qualitatively assessment should be considered when thinking about the analytical results. If data is categorised as highly uncertain and having a large impact on results, then final outputs will be subject to large uncertainty.</h3>
