<h1><span class="header-section-number">Section 4</span> Presenting and Communicating uncertainty</h1>
<p><h5right> This chapter looks at how to choose <i>which</i> messages we should communicate to decision makers about uncertainty, and gives advice on <i>how</i> to communicate those messages effectively.</h5right></p>
<h4>
Choosing what to communicate
</h4>
<p><h5right> The analysis of uncertainty is often complex, and presenting this in its entirety may be overwhelming to the recipient. Therefore we need to choose which messages about uncertainty to communicate to decision makers – ensuring they receive enough information to understand the key points, without receiving so much that it clouds the central issue. <br><br> The overall uncertainty is what we need to communicate, but often we don’t have a clearly quantified measure of this. </h5right></p>
<div id="framing-the-different-uncertainties" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Framing the different uncertainties</h2>
<p><h5left><br> If most uncertainty is quantified then present this prominently </h5left></p>
<div id="if-most-of-the-overall-uncertainty-has-been-quantified-aleatory-or-epistemic-then-this-should-be-the-most-prominent-message.-discussion-of-the-unquantified-uncertainties-and-risks-can-be-included-but-should-be-positioned-so-that-they-dont-reduce-confidence-in-the-main-results-unnecessarily." class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.1</span> If most of the overall uncertainty has been quantified (aleatory or epistemic), then this should be the most prominent message. Discussion of the unquantified uncertainties and risks can be included, but should be positioned so that they don’t reduce confidence in the main results unnecessarily.</h3>
</div>
<div id="if-there-are-significant-unquantified-uncertainties-epistemic-or-ontological-then-presenting-the-uncertainty-that-has-been-quantified-may-give-a-misleading-impression-of-precision-and-thereby-underestimate-the-uncertainty-i.e.dont-present-a-range-if-you-know-that-there-are-substantial-uncertainties-that-are-not-accounted-for-in-that-range." class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.2</span> If there are significant unquantified uncertainties (epistemic or ontological), then presenting the uncertainty that has been quantified may give a misleading impression of precision and thereby underestimate the uncertainty (i.e. don’t present a range if you know that there are substantial uncertainties that are not accounted for in that range).</h3>
<p><h5left><br> However, if little is quantified, then it may be better to present no quantification at all </h5left></p>
</div>
<div id="if-the-greatest-source-of-uncertainty-is-the-potential-for-a-risk-outside-of-the-analysis-to-be-realised-then-this-should-be-the-most-prominently-displayed-message." class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.3</span> If the greatest source of uncertainty is the potential for a risk outside of the analysis to be realised, then this should be the most prominently displayed message.</h3>
<p><h5left><br> If there is a major risk that has not been included in the analysis, then this may be greatest uncertainty </h5left></p>
</div>
<div id="if-quality-assurance-has-been-very-limited-then-presenting-any-measure-of-uncertainty-may-be-misleading.-in-such-circumstances-where-the-greatest-source-of-uncertainty-is-the-potential-for-error-then-this-should-be-the-most-prominent-message-that-is-conveyed-to-the-decision-maker.-this-may-be-in-the-form-of-an-analytical-assurance-statement-that-highlights-areas-of-concern." class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.4</span> If quality assurance has been very limited then presenting any measure of uncertainty may be misleading. In such circumstances where the greatest source of uncertainty is the potential for error, then this should be the most prominent message that is conveyed to the decision maker. This may be in the form of an analytical assurance statement that highlights areas of concern.</h3>
<p><h5left><br> If quality assurance has been very limited, it may be best to lead with this </h5left></p>
</div>
<div id="think-about-how-caveats-are-presented-a-long-list-is-unhelpful-but-two-or-three-upfront-that-have-the-most-impact-on-the-results-are-likely-to-be-more-helpful-and-easily-understood." class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.5</span> Think about how caveats are presented – a long list is unhelpful, but two or three upfront that have the most impact on the results are likely to be more helpful and easily understood.</h3>
<p><h5left><br> Front load the important caveats and explain why they matter </h5left></p>
<h4>
Deciding how to communicate it
</h4>
<p><h5right> Now you have determined what the message is you need to consider how to communicate with your decision makers. What kind of situation are you in – written report, presentation, or an oral briefing with or without visuals? Any constraints on format may steer you to an approach. <br><br> Regardless of the situation, we recommend putting the uncertainty first when communicating – e.g “These results are interim. This policy showed a saving £xm in 2017 and therefore…”. The rationale is that we read top to bottom, so put the key caveat first. <br><br> This section considers a range of approaches based on your understanding of the audience and the type of message you need to deliver <br><br> You should also consider the onward communication of your message to ensure that when your work is passed on its core message and integrity are maintained. </h5right></p>

<li>
Non-analytical

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.5</span> Think about what motivates the decision maker.

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.3</span> An exception to this is where there is an established system within the sector for attaching terminology to probabilities, one that can be assumed to be well-understood by the intended audience. For example:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
According to the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), “very likely” means 90-100% probability.
</li>
<li>
According to NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence), probabilities of between 1 in 100 and 1 in 10 are referred to as “common”.
</li>
<li>
GAD have said it’s more effective to say this event (e.g. rivers flooding) will occur “once every 50 years” rather than “2% of the time”.
</li>
</ul>
