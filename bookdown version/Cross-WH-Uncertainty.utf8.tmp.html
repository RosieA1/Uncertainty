<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Asking the right question</h1>
<p><h5right> This section looks at the steps to ensure that analysts and policy makers understand the question being asked, how output ranges will be used, and how we can appropriately incorporate uncertainty into the analysis. </h5right></p>
<h4>
Agreeing what the question is
</h4>
<p><h5right> Before any analysis begins we should work hard to define the precise &quot;exam question&quot;. </h5right></p>
<div id="understanding-the-problem" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Understanding the problem</h2>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.1</span> It is important to ensure that the question is correctly framed to address the problem. For example, are we really interested in 'how much money will my policy save?', or should we be asking 'what is the likelihood that this policy would save more than £x?'.</h3>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.2</span> As well as clearly identifying the overarching question to answer, we should also ensure that any sub-questions to support the analysis are appropriately thought through. For example - in an education context we may be interested in uncertainty on both an academic and a financial year basis.</h3>
<h4>
Appropriate use of outputs
</h4>
<p><h5right> Once the question and sub-questions have been agreed, analysts and decision makers should discuss how the outputs are intended to be used. Understanding the role of the analysis in the broader decision-making context is important as it will help to inform which uncertainty techniques are appropriate and proportionate.</h5right></p>

<h4>
Incorporating uncertainty into analysis
</h4>
<p><h5right> Now that we know what the question is and the context in which the outputs will be used, we should agree how to build appropriate uncertainty into the analysis. It is a good idea to take the decision maker to the end of the process right at the start. What is it conceptually that they <i>would like</i> to be able to say? This is important as it frames the way in which the analysis will work. </h5right></p>

<div id="sources-of-uncertainty" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Sources of uncertainty</h1>
<p><h5right> Uncertainty can feed through into analysis from many different sources. Each step in data collection, data processing and modelling is likely to bring added uncertainty. <br><br> Try to identify and record all the potential sources of uncertainty in your analysis at an early stage. Early identification of uncertainty is important, if you overlook a potential source of uncertainty this could reduce the usefulness and impact of your subsequent analysis. </h5right></p>
<h4>
Classifications of uncertainty
</h4>
<p><h5right> It is useful to distinguish between distinct classifications of uncertainty. Firstly, understanding the characteristics of different classifications of uncertainty by type can help you to identify sources of uncertainty in your own analysis. Further, categorising the types of uncertainty in an analytical problem provides a framework for the next steps of analysis. Once uncertainty has been identified, you should then ask: can you quantify the uncertainty, and can you reduce it?<br><br> A common classification divides uncertainty into aleatory, epistemic and ontological types. We explain these in the table below. </h5right></p>

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><b>Definition</b></td>
<td>Known knowns are things we know that we know. Aleatory uncertainty refers to the inherent uncertainty that is always present due to underlying probabilistic variability. Since we are aware of aleatory uncertainty and can estimate average values and variation, we usually regard it as a ‘known known’</td>
<td>Known unknowns are things that we know we don’t know. Epistemic uncertainty comes from a lack of knowledge about the (complex) system we are trying to model. Assumptions are used to plug these gaps in the absence of information.</td>
<td>Unknown unknowns are things that we don't know we don't know. Ontological uncertainty usually comes from factors or situations that we have not previously experienced and therefore cannot consider because we simply don't know where to look in the first instance.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><b>Can it be quantified? </b></td>
<td>We can quantify aleatory uncertainty. We usually characterise this type of uncertainty using a probability distribution function (PDF). A PDF gives all the possible values that a variable can have and assigns a probability of occurrence to each. As analysts, the challenge for us is to derive the PDF.</td>
<td>Epistemic uncertainty can be quantified (but isn’t always) – e.g. through sensitivity analysis. These techniques quantify the uncertainty by altering assumptions and observing the impact on modelling outputs. They will work if the range of assumptions tested covers the range of unknown variables.</td>
<td>Ontological uncertainty cannot be quantified. We cannot identify unknowable unknowns, so there are no actions we can take to quantify them. What we can do is be clear about the sources of uncertainty we have included, so that any others subsequently identified would likely add to that uncertainty.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><b> Can it be reduced? </b></td>
<td>This type of uncertainty cannot be completely removed. We can sometimes reduce it through data smoothing or increasing the size of a sample, but there will always be some random variability.</td>
<td>Epistemic uncertainty is reducible. Epistemic uncertainty can be reduced by gathering information to lessen the gaps in our knowledge. Using new data sources, expanding our data collection or conducting research can remove the need for assumptions or refine their ranges.</td>
<td>This type of uncertainty is not reducible. However, ontological uncertainty can usually be separated into &quot;unknowable unknowns&quot; and &quot;knowable unknowns&quot;. Horizon scanning can help identify knowable unknowns. Once they are identified they become epistemic uncertainties.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><b> Example </b></td>
<td>Tossing a coin is an example of aleatory uncertainty. We can observe the possible outcomes (heads or tails) and the probability of each occurring (50:50), therefore create a PDF. However, prior to the coin being tossed we cannot reduce the uncertainty in outcomes.</td>
<td>Taking our coin toss example, we don't know whether the coin is fair in the first instance. We may assume the coins is fair and will give a 50% probability of each outcome. Once we start to toss the coin, we start to gather information on its fairness. The longer we toss the coin the better our information gets and the greater the reduction in epistemic uncertainty.</td>
<td>Unknown unknown are often future events or circumstances that we cannot predict. An example could be the introduction of a new technology that was previously unheard of. If the new technology affects the operation of a system, previous analysis is no longer reliable as it didn't account for this change.</td>

Sources of uncertainty
</h4>
<p><h5right> In this section, we set out some considerations to help you think about sources of uncertainty, and how you might quantify the size and impact of uncertainty at distinct stages of the analysis process. <br><br> To gain a full picture of the impact of uncertainty on your analysis it is important to think through what you know about the size and distribution of uncertainties, and how you might include this information in your analysis. The list is not exhaustive. Rather, it is intended as an aid to critical thinking about practical steps you can take to quantify uncertainty. <br><br> Usually, it is not possible to quantify exactly the level of uncertainty in your analysis. Where measurement is difficult or incomplete, think about what you can say about the reliability of your measures and what might be missing. </h5right></p>

<td align="left"><b>Monte Carlo:</b> Analyses large numbers of well understood uncertainties</td>
<td align="left">Each source of uncertainty is assigned a distribution of their potential impact, which should be discussed and agreed with stakeholders where possible. Any interactions between these sources should also be modelled, as the results could be skewed. <br><br> A single scenario is created by selecting values from these distributions and seeing what value the model would give under these conditions. This is repeated many times and the outputs can be analysed to assess the overall uncertainty. <br><br> Be careful not to mix uncertainty and risks, as often you may want to have a distinction between how you handle uncertainty and risk.</td>

<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><b> Combine Two Normally Distributed Uncertainties </b> <br><br> Time and effort can be saved when all uncertainty distributions are normal (or can be assumed to be normal).</td>
<td align="left">For two (or more) independent normally distributed uncertainties, you can produce a combined distribution by <br><br>(1) summing the means to produce a mean of the combined distribution; <br><br> (2) taking the square root of the sum of the variances to produce the standard deviation of the combined distribution.</td>
<td align="left">Simple and less resource intensive approach (relative to Monte Carlo) of combining uncertainties</td>
<td align="left">User has to be sure the individual distributions are independent and normal</td>
<td align="left">Particularly useful in the finance context, where uncertainty of overall spend/budget is essential to understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><b>Factor Analysis </b> <br><br> Reduces large numbers of correlated sources of uncertainty to a handful of underlying factors</td>
<td align="left">The sources of uncertainty are analysed and a smaller number of independent underlying factors are decided on - these should not be picked by the analyst in isolation, but agreed with relevant stakeholders. <br><br> The sources of uncertainty should then be expressed as functions of underlying factors. Analysis is this done on how uncertainty in the factors drives the modelling outcome.</td>

<td align="left">Demographic analysis, where there are many correlated characteristics</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><b>Scenario Testing</b> <br><br> Assess the impact of a few specific possibilities</td>
<td align="left">Rather than assessing the full range of outcomes, it may be appropriate to assess the impact of a few specific scenarios where there is insufficient knowledge on underlying uncertainty. These scenarios should be agreed with stakeholders to ensure they are realistic and provide a useful result.<br><br> This analysis contains no information on how likely a scenario is to occur so care needs to be taken when communicating the results. For example, while a worst-case figure may be useful to provide an upper bound of costs, it should only be present alongside a best-case figure to give a full range of outcomes.</td>

<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><b>Judgement</b><br><br> A subjective interpretation of the outputs (e.g. +/- 10% of output)</td>
<td align="left">Where there is too little information or time to do a quantified analysis, it may be better to provide a judgement on the uncertainty than nothing at all.<br><br> Wherever possible, this should be given a quantified value even if this is decided subjectively, as descriptive terms may be interpreted very differently by different people. If no figure can be given, a RAG rating may be an alternative that removes some of the ambiguity.<br><br> However the uncertainty is measured, make sure that it is clear that it is a subjective opinion rather than results of analysis to prevent it being misused.</td>
<td align="left">Can be produced very quickly <br><br> Requires little to no data</td>

</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><b>Dominant Uncertainty</b><br><br> If one uncertainty has a much greater impact than all the others</td>
<td align="left">If you have a dominant uncertainty, then the uncertainty due to this one factor is a reasonable proxy for the overall uncertainty. You can test the impact of uncertainty on outputs by varying the inputs and understanding the robustness of your assumptions. <br><br> If the dominant uncertainty can be quantified, then the outputs of this stage may simply be a sensitivity analysis. Conducting dominant uncertainty analysis may underestimate the overall uncertainty. However, when time is very tight this may be a favourable proportionate response.</td>
<td align="left">Only the main uncertainty needs to be tested, which saves time and resource <br><br> By focusing on one input, it may focus attention on the main uncertainty and lead to additional resource understanding and reducing the uncertainty, having a favourable impact overall</td>
<td align="left">May underestimate overall uncertainty as other factors excluded</td>
<td align="left">The Accuracy Tracking Tool <b>link to DfE Accuracy Tracking tool</b> can be used to estimate the residual uncertainty once the dominant has been modelled. This tool assesses the accuracy of different forecast elements and allows you to see the percentage which both the dominant and residual uncertainty contribute to the total error.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><b>Break-Even Analysis </b> <br><br> Useful to understand the point at which a saving becomes a cost</td>
<td align="left">Even in complex models with interdependencies, it may be helpful to take a step back and think about the critical inputs that affect the outputs of a model. Other techniques give a range of outputs. Break-even analysis works backwards - if we were to break even, what would the input be? <br><br> We would consider how much the input has to change before we break -even and the probability of this occurring</td>
<td align="left">Gets customers to think about the assumptions used in the modelling and helps their understanding of the critical break-even point <br><br>Simple to conduct</td>
<td align="left"></td>
<td align="left">Calculating how far the take up rate of a policy can fall before the savings become a cost. For example, you might have a policy with a £5m benefit, and a range of £5m cost to £15m benefit. Overall, this might look appealing. But if the take up rate is assumed to be 50% and break-even analysis shows it must be 30% for a benefit, assumption owners will have to think about how likely that is.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><b> Dealing with Longer Term Uncertainty</b><br><br> If long term uncertainty is unknown it is possible to extrapolate future uncertainty (particularly if short/medium term uncertainty is known)</td>
<td align="left">For a known medium-term uncertainty distribution, it is possible to extrapolate long term standard deviation by using the rate of change over the short to medium term. This will provide an analytically robust estimation of future uncertainty but may not be a true reflection of long term uncertainty. <br><br><b>Assumption:</b> Long term uncertainty could be assumed to be unchanged from medium term uncertainty. This is useful in situations when long term action won't allow large deviations, for example, long term forecasts of inflation are unlikely to have more uncertainty than medium term forecasts as the BofE (and the Government) would take measures to control its level</td>
<td align="left">A method for extrapolating into the longer term</td>
<td align="left">If the distribution of long term uncertainty is known, this is usually preferable - even if this is unmanageable, this is an accurate reflection of output confidence and resulting action should be a reflection of this <br><br> Should consider whether the extrapolation is a true reflection of uture uncertainty and whether this level of ever increasing uncertainty becomes unmanageable and irrelevant after a certain point?</td>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Presenting and Communicating uncertainty</h1>
<p><h5right> This chapter looks at how to choose <i>which</i> messages we should communicate to decision makers about uncertainty, and gives advice on <i>how</i> to communicate those messages effectively.</h5right></p>
<h4>
Choosing what to communicate
</h4>
<p><h5right> The analysis of uncertainty is often complex, and presenting this in its entirety may be overwhelming to the recipient. Therefore we need to choose which messages about uncertainty to communicate to decision makers – ensuring they receive enough information to understand the key points, without receiving so much that it clouds the central issue. <br><br> The overall uncertainty is what we need to communicate, but often we don’t have a clearly quantified measure of this. </h5right></p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.1</span> If most of the overall uncertainty has been quantified (aleatory or epistemic), then this should be the most prominent message. Discussion of the unquantified uncertainties and risks can be included, but should be positioned so that they don’t reduce confidence in the main results unnecessarily.</h3>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.4</span> If quality assurance has been very limited then presenting any measure of uncertainty may be misleading.

<p><h5left><br> Front load the important caveats and explain why they matter </h5left></p>
<h4>
Deciding how to communicate it
</h4>
<p><h5right> Now you have determined what the message is you need to consider how to communicate with your decision makers. What kind of situation are you in – written report, presentation, or an oral briefing with or without visuals? Any constraints on format may steer you to an approach. <br><br> Regardless of the situation, we recommend putting the uncertainty first when communicating – e.g “These results are interim. This policy showed a saving £xm in 2017 and therefore…”. The rationale is that we read top to bottom, so put the key caveat first. <br><br> This section considers a range of approaches based on your understanding of the audience and the type of message you need to deliver <br><br> You should also consider the onward communication of your message to ensure that when your work is passed on its core message and integrity are maintained. </h5right></p>
